# Visualization of Transit Infrastructure in Large Cities

This project aims to provide a detailed overview and analysis of public transportation infrastructure in major cities using historical and current data. Through the visual representation of data on routes, systems, stops, and tracks, users can gain a better understanding of the evolution and current state of urban public transport networks. Such visualizations can serve as tools for exploring the past, analyzing the present, and planning for the future.
